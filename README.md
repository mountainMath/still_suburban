# still_suburban
Reproduce the CanU reportand explore other definitions of growth.

The idea is to use the definitions for urban areas from the [CanU report]([CanU report](http://www.canadianurbanism.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Still-Suburban-report-For-Release-comp.pdf)) and play with the growth definitions to e.g. distinguis growth of regions from growth of population within each region.
